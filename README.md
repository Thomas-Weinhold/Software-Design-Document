# Software-Design-Document
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room outsourced a project to a consulting firm. The project entailed building software that would enable more operating systems to access a web based application called Draw It Or Lose It.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I felt very confident in creating the design document necessary for developers to follow the concepts necessary to script the necessary code.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Yes, following the design document gave helpful insite into writing the necessary cde.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would find a better approach to presenting the data than the limited space on a word document table. There are hundreds of ways to diplay information with better presentation.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  It's important to consider the most available operating system, the best possible storage managment, and how memory will be managed for the client. It's also very important to build an UML diagram so that any developer could pick up the work and build on to the program.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Always utilize object oriented programing. Focus on the necessary objects. Take advantage of all available resources, and ask for help when there is an insurmountable wall.
